<h1>JavaScript Practice</h1>
**This repository contains practice code that I have written to teach myself the JavaScript language.**
Beginning with control flow, variables, then onto loops, and eventually data Structures this is a practice also for me to become more comfortable in making <strong>GitHub Commits and changes</strong>
I am a bit nervous, but at the same time excited to grow my skills as a programmer and one day call my self a <em> software engineer</em>
As Lao Tzu said,*The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.*
